<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Joshua Brown<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> JC425618/13297970</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>This website is to improve business demand by expanding awareness of "cossieplay".This will encourage more people to engage in their business products thus increasing sales by at least 50% per month and increasing people from different ages attending functions.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> The success will be measured during a 6-month trial. All new consumers will be asked where they heard/read about "cossieplay" and what age bracket they are to create a table to outline where the extra demand has come from. At the end of every month, the table can be calculated to show any increased business demand and to see if the website is achieving its goal.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience for this website is both male and female between the ages of 17-25. The website will be targeting them by a simple to use layout without huge amounts of writing on each page. The website has easy links to all information, including signing up/contacting “Cossieplay”.  The “pre-owned” page also helps to bring new people (possibly under 18) to cosplay with affordable first options as well as announcements on the home page to get the target audience engaged. </p>
